# Role-Based Task Management System (Backend)

This is a backend application built using **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**.  
The project focuses on implementing **JWT-based authentication** and **role-based access control (RBAC)** to manage tasks within an organization.

The system supports multiple user roles such as **Admin, Manager, and Employee**, each with different permissions for creating, assigning, viewing, and updating tasks.

This project is being developed as a learning-focused, industry-relevant backend application suitable for entry-level backend developer roles.
